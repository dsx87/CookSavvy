# CookSavvy

A hobby iOS recipe app that suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (UIKit only when absolutely necessary)
- **Database:** GRDB (SQLite wrapper)
- **Subscriptions:** StoreKit 2
- **Philosophy:** Maximize use of Apple frameworks

## Build Instructions

To build the app for any available iOS Simulator (avoiding specific version issues), use:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme CookSavvy -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
```

> **DO NOT run UI tests** — UITests are disabled in all test plans and must not be executed by Claude or any automated tool. They require manual execution only.

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Display Name | Recipe Source | Ingredient Detection |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Free | Free | Local database (`OfflineRecipeSource`) | Manual text input + 5 camera scans/week |
| Premium | CookSavvy+ | Local + REST API + AI (`OnlineRecipeSource`, `AIRecipeSource`) | Unlimited AI photo recognition |

- Product identifiers: monthly `com.cooksavvy.subscription.premium` (7-day introductory free trial), annual `com.cooksavvy.subscription.premium.yearly`
- Free tier weekly camera scan limit tracked via `CameraScanTracker` (UserDefaults)
- Premium-gated features: `PaidFeature` enum — `cameraIngredientDetection`, `onlineRecipes`, `aiRecipes`, `shoppingList`

## Architecture Rules

### MVVM + Coordinator Pattern
- **Views** contain **only** a `viewModel` property
- All state/variables live inside the **ViewModel**
- **Coordinators** handle navigation and ViewModel creation
- Strict separation of concerns:
  - Views: UI presentation only
  - ViewModels: Business logic and state
  - Coordinators: Navigation flow
  - Services: Data operations

### Dependency Injection
- `AppContainer`: `@MainActor` singleton holding all shared service instances
- Services initialized once and exposed via protocol-typed dependencies in coordinators and view models
- Shared cross-cutting services such as `LoggingServiceProtocol` are resolved in `AppContainer`, and feature-specific `LoggerProtocol` instances are injected into view models
- Construction is throwing; startup database/container failures render a blocking startup error instead of falling back to in-memory storage
- Maintains single source of truth for app-wide dependencies
- TODO: refactor away from singleton pattern

### Code Duplication Policy
- **No duplication** — search for existing solutions first
- Refactor only when necessary; prefer adding new methods over modifying existing ones
- Duplication allowed only for unrelated modules or logic that may diverge — **requires explicit approval**

### Code Style
- **SwiftUI readability** — avoid deeply nested view bodies by extracting subviews into `private var` or `private func` computed properties
- **No magic numbers/strings** — all layout values go in `UI` constants; all user-facing strings go in `Strings`; all SF Symbol names go in `Icons`
- **Services always have protocols** — every new service must be defined behind a protocol so it can be mocked in tests and DEBUG builds
- Follow **Single Responsibility Principle**

## Workflow Rules

- **Ask before coding** if you need more info (unless instructed otherwise)
- **Comments:** Default is `none` for trivial or self-explanatory code. Every addition of meaningful, nontrivial logic must include inline comments and a concise explanation of the logic where it is implemented. When introducing complex objects, document them inline with their purpose, relation to surrounding types/services, and a clear description of what the object represents or coordinates.
- **Documentation maintenance:** After introducing structural changes (new services, screens, coordinators, architecture shifts, or dependency changes), check `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` and update them to reflect the current state of the project
- **Build check:** After each finished request that changes code, verify the project builds using `xcodebuild -scheme CookSavvy -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` — always target generic iOS Simulator, never a specific simulator version (unless explicitly requested). If no code changes were introduced, no build needs to be run.
- **Unit tests:** After significant logic changes, run the `UnitTests` test plan: `xcodebuild test -scheme CookSavvy -destination '<destination>' -testPlan UnitTests` — do not run the default test plan (which includes everything) unless explicitly requested. Never hardcode a specific simulator name/version (a bare `platform=iOS Simulator` only works for `build`, not `test` — `test` needs a concrete device). Resolve `<destination>` in this order:
  1. **Booted simulator** — if one is already running, target it by UDID: `xcrun simctl list devices booted` → `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UDID>'`
  2. **Available simulator** — otherwise list installed devices (`xcrun simctl list devices available`) and target any available iPhone by UDID
